## Requirements

You have to install two 3rd-party packages: `numpy` and `scikit-learn`.

### Numpy

You might have to install numpy manually. Please follow the
[official guide](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/install.html) to do so.

### Scikit-learn

Scikit-learn is also called sklearn. Don't be confused by that, it is the same
package. Please follow the
[official guide](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html) to
install it.
