A blogger posted [an article](http://stu.mp/2012/10/my-patent-pending-3-question-technical-interview.html)
about interview questions. One of them was:

> There is a multi-level directory tree, say a local git checkout, 
> that has a number of files all with the extension .tmp. How would 
> you delete all files with the .tmp extension in a single command 
> regardless of where they sit in the directory tree?

I've added some sample files and directories for you to test if 
your solution works.
